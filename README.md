Machine learning Pipeline.
In this section, we outline the fundamental aspect of our coursework.
Objective:
The primary goal is to leverage the MLEnd Yummy dataset and train a model to distinguish between images featuring dishes with rice and chips.
This initial problem serves as our starting point, allowing us to explore the foundational aspects of solving a binary classification problem. Subsequently, we will build upon this foundation to address more complex problems within the full dataset.
